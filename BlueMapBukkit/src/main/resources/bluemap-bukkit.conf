# By changing the setting (accept-download) below to TRUE you are indicating that you have accepted mojang's EULA (https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula),
# you confirm that you own a license to Minecraft (Java Edition)
# and you agree that BlueMap will download and use this file for you: %minecraft-client-url%
# (Alternatively you can download the file yourself and store it here: <data>/minecraft-client-%minecraft-client-version%.jar)
# This file contains resources that belong to mojang and you must not redistribute it or do anything else that is not compliant with mojang's EULA.
# BlueMap uses resources in this file to generate the 3D-Models used for the map and texture them. (BlueMap will not work without those resources.)
# %datetime-iso%
accept-download: false

# This changes the amount of threads that BlueMap will use to render the maps.
# A higher value can improve render-speed but could impact performance on the host machine.
# This should be always below or equal to the number of available processor-cores.
# Zero or a negative value means the amount of of available processor-cores subtracted by the value.
# (So a value of -2 with 6 cores results in 4 render-processes)
# Default is -2
renderThreadCount: -2

# If this is true, BlueMap might send really basic metrics reports containg only the implementation-type and the version that is being used to https://metrics.bluecolored.de/bluemap/
# This allows me to track the basic usage of BlueMap and helps me stay motivated to further develop this tool! Please leave it on :)
# An example report looks like this: {"implementation":"CLI","version":"%version%"}
metrics: true

# The folder where bluemap saves data-files it needs during runtime or to save e.g. the render-progress to resume it later.
data: "bluemap"

# The webroot of the website that displays the map.
webroot: "bluemap/web"

# Unncomment this to override the path where bluemap stores the data-files.
# Default is "<webroot>/data"
#webdata: "path/to/data/folder"

webserver {
	# With this setting you can disable the integrated web-server.
	# This is usefull if you want to only render the map-data for later use, or if you setup your own webserver.
	# Default is enabled
	enabled: true

	# The IP-Adress that the webserver binds to.
	# If this setting is commented out, bluemap tries to find the default ip-adress of your system.
	# If you only want to access it locally use "localhost".
	#ip: "localhost"
	#ip: "127.0.0.1"

	# The port that the webserver listenes to.
	# Default is 8100
	port: 8100

	# Max number of simultaneous connections that the webserver allows
	# Default is 100
	maxConnectionCount: 100
}

# This is an array with multiple configured maps.
# You can define multiple maps, for different worlds with different render-settings here
maps: [

	{
		# The id of this map
		# Should only contain word-charactes: [a-zA-Z0-9_]
		id: "world"
	
		# The name of this map
		# This defines the display name of this map, you can change this at any time
		# Default is the id of this map
		name: "World"
		
		# The path to the save-folder of the world to render
		world: "world"

		# If this is false, BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are not visible from above-ground.
		# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.
		# This improves the performance of the map on slower devices by a lot, but might cause some blocks to disappear that should normally be visible.
		# Default is false
		renderCaves: false
		
		# AmbientOcclusion adds soft shadows into corners, which gives the map a much better look.
		# This has only a small impact on render-time and has no impact on the web-performance of the map.
		# The value defines the strength of the shading, a value of 0 disables ambientOcclusion.
		# Default is 0.25
		ambientOcclusion: 0.25

		# Lighting uses the light-data in minecraft to shade each block-face.
		# If this is enabled, caves and inside buildings without torches will be darker.
		# The value defines the strength of the shading and a value of 0 disables lighting (every block will be fully lit).
		# Default is 0.8
		lighting: 0.8
		
		# With the below values you can limit the map-render.
		# This can be used to ignore the nethers ceiling or render only a certain part of a world.
		# Default is no min or max value (= infinite bounds)
		#minX: -4000
		#maxX: 4000
		#minZ: -4000
		#maxZ: 4000
		#minY: 50
		#maxY: 126
				
		# Using this, BlueMap pretends that every Block out of the defined render-bounds is AIR,
		# this means you can see the blocks where the world is cut (instead of having a see-through/xray view).
		# This has only an effect if you set some render-bounds above.
		# Default is enabled

		# With this set to true, the generated files for this world are compressed using gzip to save A LOT of space.
		# Files will be only 5% as big with compression!
		# Note: If you are using NGINX or Apache to host your map, you can configure them to serve the compressed files directly.
		# This is much better than disabling the compression.
		useCompression: true
		
		# HIRES is the high-resolution render of the map. Where you see every block.
		hires {
			# Defines the size of one map-tile in blocks.
			# If you change this value, the lowres values might need adjustment as well!
			# Default is 32
			tileSize: 32
			
			# The View-Distance for hires tiles on the web-map (the value is the radius in tiles)
			# Default is 4.5
			viewDistance: 4.5
		}
		
		# LOWRES is the low-resolution render of the map. Thats the model that you see if you zoom far out to get an overview.
		lowres {
			# Defines resolution of the lowres model. E.g. If the hires.tileSize is 32, a value of 4 means that every 8*8 blocks will be summarized by one point on the lowres map.
			# Calculation: 32 / 4 = 8
			# You can only use values that result in an integer if you use the above calculation!
			# Default is 4
			pointsPerHiresTile: 4
			
			# Defines the size of one lowres-map-tile in points.
			# Default is 50
			pointsPerLowresTile: 50
