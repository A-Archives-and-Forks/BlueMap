**BlueMap Version:**
*Full version including the target, e.g. `1.0.0-fabric-1.16.1`

I am using:
- [ ] mods (on the rendered world)

**Description:**
*Describe the bug in full detail, including a way to reproduce it.
Sometimes a full log of your server-startup or a crash-report can be of much help!*
