# and update configuration correctly.

# By changing the setting (accept-download) below to TRUE you are indicating that you have accepted mojang's EULA (https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula),
# you confirm that you own a license to Minecraft (Java Edition)
# and you agree that BlueMap will download and use this file for you: %minecraft-client-url%
# (Alternatively you can download the file yourself and store it here: <data>/minecraft-client-%minecraft-client-version%.jar)
# This file contains resources that belong to mojang and you must not redistribute it or do anything else that is not compilant with mojang's EULA.

# If this is true, BlueMap might send really basic metrics reports containg only the implementation-type and the version that is being used to https://metrics.bluecolored.de/bluemap/
# This allows me to track the basic usage of BlueMap and helps me stay motivated to further develop this tool! Please leave it on :)
# An example report looks like this: {"implementation":"CLI","version":"%version%"}

# The folder where bluemap saves data-files it needs during runtime or to save e.g. the render-progress to resume it later.

	# If you only want to access it locally use "localhost".
	#ip: "localhost"

	# The port that the webserver listenes to.
	# Default is 8100

# This changes the amount of threads that BlueMap will use to render the maps.
# A higher value can improve render-speed but could impact performance on the host machine.
# This should be always below or equal to the number of available processor-cores.
# If this value is commented out BlueMap tries to find the optimal thread count to max out render-performance

# This is an array with multiple configured maps.
# You can define multiple maps, for different worlds with different render-settings here

		world: "world"

		# If this is false, BlueMap tries to omit all blocks that are not visible from above-ground.
		# More specific: Block-Faces that have a sunlight/skylight value of 0 are removed.
		# This improves the performance of the map on slower devices by a lot, but might cause some blocks to disappear that should normally be visible.
		# Default is false
		renderCaves: false
		
		# AmbientOcclusion adds soft shadows into corners, which gives the map a much better look.
		# This has only a small impact on render-time and has no impact on the web-performance of the map.
		# The value defines the strength of the shading, a value of 0 disables ambientOcclusion.
		# Default is 0.25
		ambientOcclusion: 0.25

		# Lighting uses the light-data in minecraft to shade each block-face.
		# If this is enabled, caves and inside buildings without torches will be darker.
		# The value defines the strength of the shading and a value of 0 disables lighting (every block will be fully lit).

		# HIRES is the high-resolution render of the map. Where you see every block.
		hires {

			# Default is 3.5

		# LOWRES is the low-resolution render of the map. THats the model that you see if you zoom far out to get an overview.
		lowres {
			# Defines resolution of the lowres model. E.g. If the hires.tileSize is 32, a value of 4 means that every 8*8 blocks will be summarized by one point on the lowres map.
			# Calculation: 32 / 4 = 8
			# You can only use values that result in an integer if you use the above calculation!
			# Default is 4
